//! An inner rule that reads a relation the subquery joined.
//!
//! `WHERE c.id = <caller>` over `ON o.customer_id = c.id` asks exactly what
//! `WHERE o.customer_id = <caller>` asks, so the crate answers it as that. Every

//! because a rewrite that holds only usually is a grant `PostgreSQL` refuses.

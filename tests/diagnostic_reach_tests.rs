//! Every diagnostic a schema can reach has a schema here that reaches it.
//!
//! A diagnostic nobody can see is not a diagnostic. Measured over the whole fixture corpus
//! at all four confidence levels, 18 of the 33 notes fire and 2 of the 10 skipped-tuple
//! reasons do, so the rest were carried on the word of their construction sites. Each case
//! below is the smallest schema that makes one of them render, which is what turns "it
//! exists" into "an operator would read this".
//!
//! The cases are written against the operator-visible text, since that is what a reader
//! acts on, and a reworded message has to be looked at rather than silently accepted.
//!
//! Not here on purpose: `OwnerBoundFunction`, which
//! `footgun_requests_tests::an_owner_bound_accessor_is_reported_by_name` already covers. A
//! census that greps variant names misses that test, because it asserts the message text,
//! which is how this one came to look unreached.

/// Preconditions every admitted case satisfies, each a rule of the database.
///
/// 1. `PostgreSQL` ORs the permissive policies covering a command and ANDs the restrictive
///    ones onto that union, so however many there are the answer is a union of grants
///    narrowed by barriers. A case declares at least one permissive policy per command it
///    grants, since a command with none is denied outright.
/// 2. Every clause is an equality between one column of the guarded row and one scalar the
///    request supplies or one constant, so the row's own values settle the answer.
/// 3. The key is a single column of a type an object name can carry.
/// 4. Row-level security is on and the reader does not own the table, since an owner is
///    exempt from every policy unless the table forces it.
/// 5. Nothing the clause reads is another table, so no second table's policies apply.
/// 6. The deployment declares what the request value means. `current_setting('k')` is a
///    session key like any other, and only the deployment knows that this one carries the
///    caller's identity rather than a tenant or a flag, so an undeclared key is outside
///    the class by construction rather than by omission.
/// 7. The guarded table is not spelled as a well-known type. The translation refuses that
///    outright with `ReservedTypeName` rather than renaming anything, so it belongs outside
///    the class, and `a_table_named_as_a_reserved_type_is_refused` pins the refusal.
/// 8. Where the answer comes from a membership row, that membership table carries no row
///    security of its own. `PostgreSQL` shows every caller the same membership rows then,
///    which is what makes a tuple loaded as the owner true for everyone. A guarded

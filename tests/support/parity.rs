//! One runner for every `PostgreSQL` and `OpenFGA` parity case.
//!
//! A case declares data: a schema, a seed, the principals and the rows a write would
//! attempt. Which relations answer which statement, and how a row is named as an object,
//! come from the translation itself, so no case repeats that analysis.
//!
//! The comparison is the full cross product of principal, object and statement, in both
//! directions, so a case cannot check only the pairs its author thought of.

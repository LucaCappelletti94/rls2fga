/// A write case declares every command, changes what no policy reads, and reads a column of
/// its own per command.
///
/// Three claims the runner takes on trust. It asks the model about the row that exists rather
/// than the row a write would produce, which holds only where neither the key nor the
/// changed column is read by a policy. A command whose policy is missing falls to
/// `no_access`, which the database mirrors, so the parity run would agree while comparing
/// nothing: the four answers have to be judged. And one predicate shared by every command
/// would agree whatever the commands were wired to, so a change and a removal each read a
/// column the read does not.

//! Which relations answer one action, and which version of the row each judges.
//!
//! A statement is answered by relations the emitted model may or may not define, since a
//! policy writing one condition and a policy writing two produce different relations for
//! the same `UPDATE`. A consumer branching on which ones exist re-derives that mapping,
//! and a later revision emitting them under a further condition makes the branch judge a
//! replacement against one row version, which grants.
//!
//! Reading the relation names off the model is not enough either: nothing in the model
//! text says whether a relation judges the row as it is or as it will be, and a `WITH
//! CHECK` clause only means anything against the second.

//! Put a generated model on a running `OpenFGA` server.
//!
//! The only thing here a consumer could not write for itself is the guarantee:
//! that [`AuthorizationModel`](crate::generator::json_model::AuthorizationModel)
//! serializes into what the write call accepts. It is kept here so a rename in
//! the emitted model breaks this crate's own tests rather than a consumer's.
//!
//! Writing tuples is deliberately absent. A tuple is a
//! [`Record`](crate::types::Record), which
//! [`records_from_row`](crate::types::records_from_row) and
//! [`record_from_tuple_row`](crate::translator::Outputs::record_from_tuple_row)
//! already produce, and batching, deletion and retry are the caller's policy.
